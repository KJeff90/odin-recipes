    <p>Okay now look, first of all, I'm completely aware that Applebees is not exactly a five
        star dining establishment. And I'm not here to try to convince you otherwise; HOWEVER,
        real talk, have you ever HAD one of their Maple Butter blondies? Because BAYBEE, idk
        what it is about it, but them thangs just hit different. Whether it's the specific
        recipe for the blondie itself, the manner in which they bake it, or the 372 metric
        tons of sugar that go into making the maple butter sauce, there's just something
        about them that has earned Applebees a spot in my hall of fame for no other reason
        than to go back and have a blondie every once in a while. But you know the only thing
        more satisfying than having one of their blondies? Making one yourself. And today,
        I'll be sharing with you the secret of how to do just that from the comfort of your
        owbn home.</p>
