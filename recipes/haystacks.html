    <p>Okay, I know what you're thinking, but <strong>JUST HEAR ME OUT</strong>! If you've
        never heard of haystacks before, then first and foremost welcome to this sector of 
        the black southern christian community. When I think back to my on my early childhood
        religious experiences <em>(cough) indoctrination (cough)</em>, there is one aspect
        that I will always look back on rather fondly regardless of how I feel about the rest.
        That aspect is of the post church lunch. And there is no meal more iconic to the 
        Seventh Day Adventist community than the classic haystack. So let me put you up on game
        with one of the simplest, yet most hearty and satisfying meals that can easily feed an
        army. Allow me to introduce you...<em>to the haystack</em>.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tostitos Scoops (not sponsored)</li>
        <li>Your favorite Salsa</li>
        <li>Baked Beans</li>

    </ul></p>

        <li>Heat beans and diced tomatoes on medium while stirring in hot sauce to taste</li>
        <li>Cook ground turkey in a saucepan until browned on medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Combine your heated ingredients in the pot containing the beans.</li>
        <li>Once these items have been heated, it's just a matter of putting the <em>
        STACK</em> in haytsacks</li>
        <li>Line a plate with a layer of scoops</li>
        <li>With a serving spoon, drizzle some of the combined muxtire into each scoop</li>
